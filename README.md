A secure channel on [Bale](https://bale.ai/) messenger to use as a plugin for [shadowsocks](https://crates.io/crates/shadowsocks-rust).

## Why?

Because of censorship that may happen one day in Iran
that blocks every type of traffic to outside world except
some government-backed messengers.

## TODOs

- [ ] Secure channel by handshaking
- [ ] Proper error handling
